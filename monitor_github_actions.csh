echo "🕐 Monitoring Instructions:"
echo "=========================="
echo "1. Visit: https://github.com/SanjeevaRDodlapati/GenomicLightning/actions"
echo "2. Look for workflows triggered by commit: feat: achieve perfect 10/10 deployment readiness"
echo "3. Monitor workflow status:"
echo "   🟢 Green checkmarks = Success"
echo "   🔴 Red X marks = Failure"
echo "   🟡 Yellow dots = In progress"
echo "4. Click on failed jobs to see detailed logs"
echo "5. Expected completion time: 10-15 minutes"
